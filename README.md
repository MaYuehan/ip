If you are a Java programmer, you can use it to practice Java too. Here's the main method:

```java
public class Duke {

    private Storage storage;
    private TaskList tasks;
    private Ui ui;

    /**
     * Constructs a Duke object with the specified file path.
     *
     * @param filePath The path to the file where tasks are stored.
     */
    public Duke(String filePath) {
        ui = new Ui();
        storage = new Storage(filePath);
        try {
            tasks = new TaskList(storage.load());
        } catch (DukeException e) {
            ui.showLoadingError();
            tasks = new TaskList(new ArrayList<>());
        }
    }

    /**
     * Runs the chatbot, displaying welcome message and processing user commands.
     */
    public void run() {
        ui.showWelcome();
        boolean isExit = false;
        while (!isExit) {
            try {
                String fullCommand = ui.readCommand();
                Command c = Parser.parse(fullCommand);
                c.execute(tasks, ui, storage);
                isExit = c.isExit();
            } catch (DukeException e) {
                ui.showError(e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Duke("./data/botYue.txt").run();
    }
}
